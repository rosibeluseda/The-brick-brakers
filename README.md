# The brick brakers
**The Brick Breakers** is a game inspired by the popular Arkanoid game. Developed in C++ using Blit3D, a lightweight framework for creating games with C++ and OpenGL, the objective is to break all the bricks on the screen. The game utilizes the Box2D physics library to ensure realistic ball and paddle interactions. Players can collect three power-ups: a larger paddle, a sticky paddle, and multiple balls. The player starts with three lives and encounters bricks of varying strengths, some of which require multiple hits to break.
